# CWA ‚Äì Compare It! (Comparison Web Application)

## üîç Overview

**CWA** is a user-friendly comparison web application built to help users make smarter purchase decisions. It allows real-time price comparisons (simulated) across **medicines, cosmetics, food, and travel expenses** using a clean frontend interface built with **vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS**.

Data is served via a **static JSON server** and **Google Apps Script**, simulating live API functionality. The project includes visual insights through **Chart.js**, making it both informative and interactive.
